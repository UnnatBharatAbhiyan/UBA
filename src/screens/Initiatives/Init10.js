        p1="In today's world, we are becoming more technology-driven. One of the significant parts of technology is computers. Their application is present in almost every sphere. Computer skills have become one of the most essential skills in the field of education and employment needs. The foundation of knowledge of this competence comes from our school education. However, not everyone has that privilege, and, particularly in rural areas, students do not receive adequate education on computers, especially when it comes to practical knowledge. Keeping this in mind, Team Unnat Bharat Abhiyan, IIT Roorkee identified this problem in the schools of its adopted villages and villages near Haridwar. Thus, our team collaborated with our institute and Duayen Foundation to acquire the systems and install them in schools of the recognized villages."

        p2="The installment was done in Beladi, Meerpur, Majara, Anneki, Kutubpur, GIC Horawala, GIC Chharba, in Madarsa of Chharba and Haldwani, where a total of 95 computers were installed. Team UBA IITR hopes that this step will help the student to get more familiar with the technology and give them a better perspective and possibilities that will benefit them in the future."      />
