      village=" Beladi"
        p1="The world's largest untapped talent pool is comprised of women. Team UBA, IITR helped rural women recognize their potential in bringing rural upliftment. The team knows the importance of a strong community network in rural areas and hence always worked to uplift the SHGs, from their formation to smooth functioning."

        p2="The team contacted women of the village Beladi to form a Self Help Group (SHG). With its enthusiastic efforts, the team managed to conduct a session with the help of Mrs. Neeraj Saini, a member of an active SHG. During the session, the women were told about the importance and responsibilities of being a part of an SHG. Also, the women showed great interest in working as a group and achieving financial independence. The documentation process of SHG members was carried out smoothly with the team and Mrs. Neeraj Saini."

        p3="So the team successfully formed SHG in the village with the support of passionate members. The SHG is currently focusing on some initiatives and attended the Bio-enzyme workshop being conducted by the team."
