        p1="We shall not defeat any of the infectious diseases that plague the developing world until we have also won the battle for safe drinking water, sanitation, and basic health care. ~Kofi Annan.
        Pure water is one of the most important resources we need in our lives but those deprived of access to clean drinking water can truly understand its importance. People, when exposed to unclean water, are prone to several water-borne diseases. Also, not everyone in the village is privileged enough to install a water purifier system in their house."

        p2="Identifying this problem in villages Puranpur and Salempur, team Unnat Bharat Abhiyan, IIT Roorkee decided to install a 'Water Purifier' in these villages. The team initiated the process by testing the samples of water in the Labs at IIT Roorkee. Then the team designed the water filter under the guidance of our faculty Coordinator- Dr Bhanu Prakash Vellanki. The filter was designed on the basis of the Sand Filtration Process using sands and gravels. The team procured the required raw material. Then the gravels, sand, etc. were washed properly and then they were layered finally inside the tank. The water filter was also provided with a backwashing technique so that the filter can be cleaned as per the requirements."

        p3="In Puranpur, the set-up was done in the Government Primary School so that the students have access to clean drinking water. A similar set-up was done in village Salempur where villagers can access pure water from the water purifier."
